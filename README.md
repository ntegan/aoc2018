## Advent of Code 2018

https://adventofcode.com/2018

This repo contains a branch for each part (day 1 part 1, day 1 part 2,...)
of the Advent of Code 2018 challenge.

Each part can be ran with `cargo run --release`.

I've been doing so and pasting my puzzle input to stdin, followed by a ctrl-d
for EOF.

It would probably work just the same using `cargo run --release < puzzle_input.txt`
